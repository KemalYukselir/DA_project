# Data Analysis Project

## Overview
Many students enroll in online courses but disengage early. If we can predict which students are at risk of dropping out, educators and platforms can intervene earlier.

Goal:
Build a system that analyses student engagement data and predicts the likelihood of dropout.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Statistical modeling and hypothesis testing

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
